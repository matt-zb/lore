
no pa rents guide the soul in side | no an cest ry re sides

 | de nies my woun ded cries

 x   /     x   /      x    /      x   /
the man | he makes | the beast | he breaks ||

x  /   x   /    x     /    x    /       x   /  x   /  x   /
I run and hide from fight and strife | not out of cow ar dice 

 x     /   x  /    x   /     x     x     /    x     /     x    /
but 'cause I have no clear idea | just which half wields the knife
